3.2   a) false - begins with a lowercase letter & all subsequence words in the name begin with a capital first letter
      b) true
      c) true
      d) true
      e) false - cannot be used to invoke a method. a reference to an object is required to invoke the object's method
      f) false - can be used from the point which its declared through the end of the method declaration
      g) true
      h) false - they are initialized by being assigned a value, only primitive-type instance variables are initialized by default

      l) false such literals are type double by default


3.3   A local variable is declared in the body of a mmethod, a field is declared in a class but not in the body of any
      class's methods.
      A local variable can only be used from the point which it is declared through the end of the method declaration. Fields
      are accessible to all methods of the class.
      
      
3.4   A parameter is an additional information that a method reuires to perform its tasks. And each parameter, which is
      required by a method, is specified in the method's declaration.
      An argument is the actual value for a method parameter. When a method is called, the argument values are passed to
      the corresponding parameters of the method so that it can perform its task.
